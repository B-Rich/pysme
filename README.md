PySME
=====

This package is designed to make simulating ordinary and stochastic Gaussian
master equations as straightforward as possible. Specifically, given bath
statistics, a coupling operator, and initial conditions, it can output the
equation as a system of coupled real-valued equations suitable for a numerical
integrator of choice, and provides some default integrators.
